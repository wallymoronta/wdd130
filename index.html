      <img src="images/profile.jpg" alt="Hello, my name is Wally Moronta" width="200">
      <P>I am Wally Moronta, and I work as the Altice sales trainer for the support services group in the Dominican Republic. I have spent three years working in the call center area. As a sales trainer, my role is to teach new agents the sales processes and techniques that will help them succeed within the company. My previous experiences include working for ASPERSUD (Peruvian Association Of The Church Of Jesus Christ Of Latter Day Saints) as the secretary of visas and supplies. I also served as the secretary of finance in the Dominican Republic. These positions allowed me to gain valuable insights into community service and interacting with embassies and leaders from various countries.
         Currently, I'm pursuing a degree in software and web development at BYU (Brigham Young University). I have big plans for my future, and I hope to develop my own apps as a professional in the field. I reside in Santiago de los Caballeros, and in my free time, I enjoy playing basketball, listening to music, playing video games, and going on family outings to explore the beauty of our country. I view every change and challenge in my life as an opportunity to grow and develop new skills.
